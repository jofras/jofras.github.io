        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a recent computer science graduate from ETH Zurich, currently working as a software engineering intern in Neuchâtel. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During my degree, I spent a semester at Purdue, where I built a graphics pipeline and raced with the triathlon club. My thesis was on word embeddings from ASR transcripts, supervised by Alexander Hoyle and Ryan Cotterell.
        </p>
        <p>
            At work, I speed up code and build diagnostic tools for our team. I've been learning French along the way. What I've realized is that I enjoy the human side of building. Understanding what people actually need, designing solutions that feel intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next year, I want to start my master's in interaction design. I want to build things that make people happy.
